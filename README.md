## 💼 Who I Am

I’m not here to “teach.” I’m here to *ignite*.  
In my time at DeepNeuron, I vowed to be three things:

- 🕸 **The Spider-Man** – The bridge between education and every branch, team, or school that needed it.
- 🤖 **The Jaeger** – The synced machine. I scaled the Outreach team from 4 to 18, driving 37+ events in a year.
- 🎤 **The Hamilton** – The legacy-maker. I didn’t throw away my shot — I built systems that outlive me.

## 🏗 What I Build

### 🧠 Education Systems
- 🧾 Co-author of the [**MDN Education Handbook**](https://bit.ly/mdneducation): the definitive guide on storyboarding, presentation mechanics, and workshop architecture.
- 🛠 Architect of the **FERAL Framework** — MDN’s proprietary doctrine of workshop excellence (Flow, Aesthetic, Relatability, Engagement, Legacy).
- 📚 Presented "Workshop Workshops" that taught student teams how to teach — now powering a blitz of workshops by MAC, WEM, MNET & more.

### 🧩 Automation & Admin Ops
- 🧠 **Gamified Admin Portal** — Full-stack member tracking & RPG reward system via Notion.
- 🤖 Built **AI-guided Discord bots** to automate onboarding, task logging, and performance triggers.
- 🔁 Used **vectorisation + reinforcement learning** concepts to prototype adaptive workflow iterators.

### 🎨 Design, Branding & Aesthetic Systems
- 🎬 Designed and rigged **3D model animations** for visual-heavy workshops.
- ✍️ Built **brand kits** across MDN and collaborative orgs to unify slide language, transitions, fonts, and colours.
- 📊 Created high-fidelity, 315MB+ PowerPoint decks used in 30+ workshops across Victoria.

### 🫂 Events & Cultural Engineering
- 🎤 Ran **Escape Cup & Amazing Race**, building unforgettable student team engagement.
