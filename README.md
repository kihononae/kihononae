## 💼 Who I Am

I’m not here to “teach.” I’m here to *ignite*.  
In my time at DeepNeuron, I vowed to be three things:

- 🕸 **The Spider-Man** – The bridge between education and every branch, team, or school that needed it.
- 🤖 **The Jaeger** – The synced machine. I scaled the Outreach team from 4 to 18, driving 37+ events in a year.
- 🎤 **The Hamilton** – The legacy-maker. I didn’t throw away my shot — I built systems that outlive me.

## 🎤 On Education

> “Workshops aren’t lectures. They’re *productions* — story-driven simulations of what education could be.”  
> “We don’t teach content. We teach *confidence*.”  
> “The best educators are system engineers. They don’t scale lessons; they scale learning itself.”
